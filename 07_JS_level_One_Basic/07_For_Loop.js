// FOR LOOPS

// Javascript has two types of For Loops:
// * for - loops through a block of code a number of times
// * for/in - loops through elements of an object sequence

// What do you think will happen here?
var word = "ABCDEFGHIJK"
for (i = 0; i < word.length; i++) {
    console.log(word[i]);
